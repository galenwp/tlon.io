        <p>We believe in the power of computers to connect people, but we’re tired of today’s internet. So we've been building a new kind of OS from scratch that lives in the cloud, called <a href="https://urbit.org">Urbit</a>.</p>
        <p>Urbit is simple, built to last forever and is 100% owned by its users. There are no ads, no tracking and no megacorp watching over you. You decide what you see, who you connect with and how you compute.</p>
        <p>We want to make it easy for anyone to use Urbit in just a few clicks. Our hosting service does that, and we're almost ready to roll it out. If you'd like to try it, join the waitlist below.</p>

        <p>Today, on the surface, Urbit is a calm, independent place for you and your friends to chat, write and share links. Under the hood, Urbit is a completely general-purpose computing platform and decentralized network that’s a new layer on top of the internet. Your Urbit data and identity are yours to keep, forever.</p>
        <p>At Tlon, we find today's megacorp platforms to be frustrating to use, often creepy, and mostly disappointing. We wanted a way to build high-trust communities, to keep our data forever, and to explore what's possible when people control their own software.</p>
        <p>We weren't satisfied solving this problem halfway - we wanted a lasting solution. So we started from the ground up.. Urbit makes it possible for an individual to control their own programs and data; Tlon makes it possible for anyone to use Urbit without ever touching the command line.</p>
        <p>We don't want to juggle a mess of apps and we don't want to depend on giant platforms to make cloud computing possible. Urbit is the beginning of a new kind of personal cloud computing.</p>
        <p>We'll happily let you know when more capacity is available.</p>

        <p>(We're not the only ones working on Urbit. We've had a lot of help from friends, supporters and contributors. The network is owned by the people who use it, and the whole project is <a href="https://github.com/urbit/urbit">open source</a>. If you're curious to go deeper, but don't want to read the source code — try <a href="https://urbit.org/understanding-urbit/">these posts</a>.)</p>
