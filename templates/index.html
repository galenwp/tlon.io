        <p>Soon, you can try Urbit yourself:</p>

        <p>Urbit is for bringing together a group to chat, write, and share links. Urbit is also a general-purpose digital environment, so it will grow new and exciting capabilities in due time. There are no ads, no tracking and no lock-in. Your Urbit data and identity are yours to keep, forever.</p>
        <p>At Tlon, we find today's megacorp platforms to be frustrating to use, often creepy, and mostly disappointing. We wanted a way to build high-trust communities, to keep our data forever, and to explore what's possible when people control their own software.</p>
        <p>We didn't want to solve this problem halfway - we wanted a lasting solution. So we started from scratch with a new, radically simple computing platform. Urbit makes it possible for an individual to control their own programs and data; Tlon makes it possible for anyone to use Urbit without ever touching the command line.</p>
        <p>We don't want to juggle a mess of apps and we don't want to depend on giant platforms to make cloud computing possible. Urbit is the beginning of a new kind of personal cloud computing.</p>
        <p>With our forthcoming release of new Urbit hosting services, owning and using the world's last personal computer will be easier than ever.</p>
        <p>We'll let you know when more capacity is available:</p>
